This folder contains scripts used for analysis of various datasets after fitting. The functions might not be as modular as they need to be. The priority is to have one function that can do the post-fit process for one session, so that it is easy to gather these post-fit analysis across sessions.

Across sessions I might find repeated functions and I will gradually refactorize them out.

It can be very tailored to specific datasets.
